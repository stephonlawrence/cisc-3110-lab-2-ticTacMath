# ticTacMath
I was required to create the game without create classes/structs, without multidimensional arrays and with these specific functions.

I added 1 or 2 to srink the code a little.

x getAMove
x playAMove
x display
x validate
x checkForWin

## compile
compile by just running the following command

```
$ make
```

## run program after compilation
```
$ ./ticTacMath
```
